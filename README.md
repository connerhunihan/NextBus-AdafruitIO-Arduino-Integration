#H1 NextBus: AdafruitIO-Arduino Integration

This Arduino modifies the Adafruit MQTT Library ESP8266 
(https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library) to 
accept data from an Adafruit IO feed.  

Many thanks to Tony DiCola and Adafruit for creating the MQTT Library,
as well as Todd Treece for creating the Adafruit IO Digital Output example.
